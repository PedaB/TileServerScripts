This is a set of scripts to operate a tileserver based on
OSM2World. Everything needed is contained in this repository
and you're adviced to checkout the repository at once and link
the subdirectories/files to the appropriate locations.

== Requirements ==

* webserver
* python
* rrdtools
* mapsplit (http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Mapsplit)
* osm2world (http://osm2world.org/)
* ...

== Scripts ==

There is a central configuration file (TODO) that will be used
by all scripts.

== Website ==

The website consists of different parts:

* the web directory containing the slippy map html pages
* a directory containing the rendered tiles (3D tiles and label-tiles)
* a set of php scripts for dynamic tile generation (labels-, date-tiles)
  and some scripts to enable the used to manually rerender selected tiles

== Crontab ==

You should add at least the following lines to your cronjob

15 2 * * * cd /dir/to/scripts && ./generate_tile.py --fetch-data
0 2 * * * cd /dir/to/scripts && ./generate_tile.py --bzr-pull
*/5 * * * * cd /dir/to/scripts && ./cron_script.py

Once the scripts work you should add a "> /dev/null" redirection. Otherwise,
on any output cron assumes an error and thus sends you an email immediatly
which produces many mails ;)
